# user-courses-project
This is a simple users-courses system.
It uses Express, which is a javascript backend framework, and MongoDB, a place to store information.
To keep things safe, it uses a package called JSON Web Tokens to check who's allowed in.
Passwords are kept extra secure by turning them into a secret code using a package called bcrypt.
Plus, it lets you easily upload pictures using a package called Multer.
